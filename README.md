<h2>Web Technologies Used</h2>

* Frontend : HTML , CSS , Javascript

* How these Technologies helped me

* User Interface Design: Frontend technologies such as HTML and CSS allow us to design visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces. With HTML, we structure 
  the content of our web pages, while CSS helps style and layout elements to create a cohesive and attractive design.

* Interactivity: JavaScript is a key frontend technology that enables interactivity on our website. Through JavaScript, we can add dynamic elements, handle user 
  inputs, and create interactive features such as dropdown menus, sliders, and forms. This enhances user engagement and provides a more responsive experience.-

* <h3>Azure Static Web Apps</h3>
  Azure Static Web Apps simplifies the deployment and hosting of static websites, offering features such as:

* Automated Builds: Azure Static Web Apps automatically builds and deploys our website whenever changes are pushed to the associated GitHub repository, 
  streamlining the development workflow.

* CI/CD Pipelines: With built-in CI/CD pipelines, we can automate the testing and deployment process, ensuring rapid and reliable delivery of updates to our 
 website.

* <h3>Visual Studio Code</h3>
  Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is our preferred code editor, offering a rich set of features and extensions that enhance productivity and collaboration:

* Intuitive Interface: VS Code provides a user-friendly interface with customizable layouts, integrated terminal, and powerful debugging capabilities, enabling 
  developers to write code more efficiently.

* Extensions Ecosystem: The extensive library of VS Code extensions enhances our development experience, offering support for various languages, frameworks, and 
  tools, including Git integration, linting, and code snippets.

* Integrated Git: VS Code's seamless Git integration simplifies version control tasks, allowing us to manage code changes and track project history within the 
  editor.
* <h3>Q&A Chatbot</h3>
  I used Azure AI services to power our Q&A chatbot, enabling intelligent conversational experiences for users:
* QnA Maker: QnA Maker simplifies the creation and management of question-and-answer knowledge bases, empowering our chatbot to provide accurate and 
  contextually relevant answers to user inquiries.
